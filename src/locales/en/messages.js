A positive score shows that moods are generated by thoughts and attitudes. Such a person feels responsible for his feelings because he understands: they are caused only by him. He may not be lonely because he believes that all feelings arise only in his head. Such a view makes it possible to experience a wonderful and beautiful world.","hdu.errors.alone.2":"The negative shows that one is confident, joy and satisfaction come from the outside. This is a huge disadvantage, since the outside world is beyond his control. His mood becomes completely dependent on external factors.","hdu.errors.good":"The \"Approval\" item assesses the tendency to place self-esteem in dependence on the opinion of others. A positive score from 0 to 10 shows that the person is independent, with a healthy sense of self-worth, and a normal reaction to criticism and disapproval. A negative score from 0 to -10 shows that the person is dependent on the opinions of others. If someone criticizes him, he automatically thinks he is nothing. Since he is emotionally hypersensitive to other people's opinions, he can be easily manipulated.","hdu.errors.label.1":"A negative result shows that a person considers such things as success, love, happiness, etc. to be necessary. The person demands that those around him, and the entire universe, welcome him with open arms for his personal qualities or accomplishments. Most often this does not happen, and the person feels depression with all its consequences. Therefore, such people spend a lot of energy on their frustrations, sorrows, unhappiness. Most of life for them becomes painful, unpleasant. They often complain loudly, but do almost nothing to resolve their problems. As a result, they get less and less out of life.","hdu.errors.label.2":"A positive outcome says that a person does not think he is made for certain things. Therefore, he tries to achieve what he wants, and often gets it. He understands that each person is unique, and there is no reason why fate should obey his desires. He regards failure as a minor disappointment, not a tragedy. He does not expect perfection or justice in everything and always. He is patient and persistent, and has a high capacity for resisting frustration. As a result, he is most often ahead of the rest.","hdu.errors.love.1":"The \"Love\" item assesses a person's ability not to depend on the love of others. A positive result shows that the person treats love as desirable, but apart from that he or she has many other, no less important, interests. Love for him is not a necessary condition for happiness and self-respect. People find this type attractive-he has a healthy sense of self-love and is interested in many of life's problems.","hdu.errors.love.2":"The negative result shows that the person is subservient to love, for him it is a necessary condition for survival and happiness. The closer the sum is to -10 , the stronger the dependence on love, the more the person agrees to a subordinate position for fear of alienation. As a result, loss of respect. People see these types as burdensome to themselves. As soon as they are rejected, pushed away, they, realizing that a lack of daily dose of attention and sympathy awaits them, become impulsive and engage in manipulation to achieve their goals. Their insistence on love and attention repels those around them, reinforcing loneliness.","hdu.errors.power.1":"The item \"Omnipotence\" assesses the tendency to consider oneself the center of the universe and to ascribe to oneself responsibility for everything that happens. A negative score indicates the presence of cognitive distortion; taking responsibility for independent events. The individual unreasonably blames himself for the misdeeds of others beyond his control. He is overwhelmed by guilt and self-judgment. The feeling that he must be all-powerful makes him helpless.","hdu.errors.power.2":"A positive result shows that a person is happy, understanding that he is not the center of the earth; no one is responsible for anyone else. This position does not isolate him from others. Rather, the opposite creates emotional barriers. He treats people as partners and is not afraid of their disagreement. Because he treats people fairly, many people are attracted to him because he is not at all inclined to control them. People listen to his ideas because he does not force his point of view. He does not seek power, and people give it to him. His relationship with his loved ones can be called reciprocity, not dependency. He does not seek to take the upper hand, and people love and respect him.","hdu.errors.supers.1":"The Flawlessness item assesses the tendency to do everything perfectly. If the result is negative, the person demands flawlessness from himself or herself. Mistakes are unacceptable, failure is worse than death, even negative emotions are a disaster; one must feel, think, and behave superperfectly; if not, one feels as if one is burning in the fires of hell. No matter how fast a person runs in such a situation, he will not reach his ideal. As soon as he gets close to one goal, he immediately faces another. He wonders why the seemingly real joy of victory does not materialize. His life is devoid of joy and pleasure. He carries through life personal standards that are far from reality and need to be re-evaluated. If one places his expectations in the realm of the real, he experiences the joy of victory.","hdu.errors.supers.2":"A positive result indicates the ability to set reasonable goals. The person enjoys the process of achieving the goal, not focusing only on the result. He understands that he does not have to be outstanding at everything and does not have to try hard at everything all the time. He is not afraid of making mistakes, seeing them as a great opportunity to learn something and improve his nature. Paradoxically, he is likely to be much more productive than his flawless partners, since he does not depend entirely on the details, on getting them right. His life is like a flowing river compared to that of his perfect friends, who can be compared to eternal ice.","hdu.errors.work":"The negative result is a dependence on work; one sees oneself as a commodity in the marketplace. The lower the amount, the more one's joy and capacity for happiness depends on success in work. If you go on vacation, leaving unfinished or unfinished business, if you resign or become ill and cannot continue working, you are in danger of having an emotional breakdown. Economic depression and emotional depression are no different for you. A positive outcome, on the other hand, shows that one gets satisfaction from work, but it is not the only way for one to maintain self-esteem.","hdu.text.1":"When we are depressed, we are guided by a set of negative beliefs and attitudes. <0>We stubbornly see more of the bad and miss the neutral and positive.</0> We are prejudiced against ourselves, others, and the world.
